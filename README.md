Car Trading made easy with TrueValue

The project uses an MVC architecture. The Model, Views, Controller, and Routers modules make up the project's framework. All the common design components are taken out of the various files and put into the partials folder of Views, where they are then put back into all of the views. Items that are available for trading are represented by a file called item.js that is produced in the Model folder. Each item object has characteristics including an id (unique), a name, a category, a description, a store address, and an image (currently default). This file offers a CRUD interface for modifying trade objects, including getting all items, getting the item identified by id, updating the item identified by id, deleting the item identified by id, and creating new trade items.

Both mainroute.js and traderoute.js contain routes for the primary site navigation, contact information, and about requests in the Routers folder. Traderoute.js has RESTful routes for requests related to trading items. Both maincontroller.js and tradecontroller.js contain controller functions in the Controllers folder that deal with requests related to general site navigation and requests related to items and trades, respectively. The error handler provided in the app.js file is used to handle any mistakes such as entering the wrong URL (bad request) or any other errors. The server cannot find the url specified when travelling to the home page, visitors are informed every time they enter a bad url.

The index.ejs page, which has a welcome message on it, serves as the website's landing page. As soon as the user selects Explore! customers are taken to the website's trades.ejs list of available products. This view shows a list of every item falling under the chosen category. Users can select a certain product from the list and view all its details by clicking on it (trade.ejs). A specific product's name, category, description, store address, and image are all displayed by the trade.ejs (default one currently). The Edit, Delete, Add to Cart, and Save for Later buttons are also present on this page. The last 2 buttons now direct users to the trades.ejs view. Edit and Delete buttons, respectively, allow users to change or remove cars. Users who click the Edit button are taken to the edit.ejs view, where they can edit a form with already-filled values for a particular car. Users are forwarded to the trade.ejs view with the new value(s) once the value(s) have been updated and the Update button has been clicked. Using the delete button, the car model can be removed.

Anyone interested in joining us and selling their cars on our website should click “Trade Check” button. Then enter the car details (newtrade.ejs). Users must fill out the form in this view and then click the Add Item button to be sent to the trades.ejs view, where a new car will have been added to the list below its category, as illustrated in the image below. On the home page, there are other navigational connections. They are Register, About, Contact, and Login. When users select Login, they are taken to the login.ejs page, where they can sign up as new users or log into their accounts as existing users (signup.ejs). users click the register button! The link takes the user to the signup.ejs page, where they can register and log in again. The bottom of the page's About link displays the about.ejs view, while the Contact link takes viewers to the contact.ejs view, where they can submit a form with their questions. The message view(message.ejs) is shown with a message once the form has been filled out.

Database Integration for MongoDB has been put into place during this project phase. Instead of hardcoding all the current items in the model, they are all obtained from MongoDB. Whenever a new item is added, it is also automatically added to the database. Schema and Model are built in the item.js file located in the modes folder to access the items and use the database. In a collection called Things, all the items are kept.

# Additional Functionalities: 

This project has a new feature called Cart, which allows users to add products and specify the quantity they need. Users can enter the quantity of a product on the trade.ejs page, and when they click the add to cart button, the page cartPage.ejs, which displays the goods and quantity added to the cart along with navigation to the cart, is called. The cart page (cart.ejs), where all the products in the cart are viewable, is the page that is reached after clicking the cart button on the home page. After visiting cart.ejs, users can view item information by clicking on them, which reroutes to cartTrade.ejs page. 

Users have the option to change and delete the item that is currently displayed on the page mentioned above. Users who click on the edit page are taken to the cartEdit.ejs page, where they can change the item's quantity. After updating the quantity of item, it redirects to cartTrade.ejs page which shows the updated quantity value. Along with this item in the cart can also be deleted by using the delete button.

A new Schema and model object are created in cart-item.js file under the models folder to access cart-related items from DB. All cart items are stored in the same DB Webapp but in a different collection named cart. Additionally, the cart-item model and user model are combined to ensure that only authenticated users can access each user's cart and perform cart-related actions. An additional attribute called “CreatedBy” has been added to the existing trade model in order to implement data modeling, i.e., to connect the Trade model and the user model, and the Added By attribute has been added to the cart-item model. To integrate the trading and save for later capabilities, a few adjustments have been made to the current project. 

New properties have been added to the item.js model (trade items), including Status(String), OfferName(String), Saved(Boolean), and Offered(Boolean). Items for offers and stored items are saved using two new models, item offer.js and item save.js, respectively. Both models use the "OfferedBy" and "SavedBy" fields, which are both parts of the User model. The values of Status, OfferName, Saved, and Offered are initially set to "Available", "", false, and false for any new transaction created by users, accordingly. Only objects that were not created by the user have the trade button enabled. When a user selects the trade button, they are taken to the item-trade.ejs page, which provides a list of the user's items from which they can choose one to trade with the previously selected item. The status of both products changes to "Offer Pending" after the offer is made, and the user is redirected to the profile page, which includes all the details about offers and trade items.
The Cancel offer button on the profile page can be used to cancel any existing offers. The owner of the trade item has the option of accepting or rejecting the user's offer after it has been made. If the offer is accepted, the status of both goods in the offer is changed to "Traded" or "Available" if the offer is rejected.

When an item is offered for trade, the value of its Offered attribute changes from false to true, and the offerName value is the name of the object through which the offer was made. When a product is added to the wishlist, the value of the Saved attribute is changed from false to true (false). A saved item may be deleted from the wishlist page or un-saved from the profile page. In addition to the above mentioned features, web app security and server-side input validation are enabled.
